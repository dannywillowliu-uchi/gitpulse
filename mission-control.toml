GitPulse: GitHub project progress visualization dashboard.

North star: a user pastes any GitHub repo URL at localhost:8000 and gets a rich
interactive dashboard with commits, contributors, code hotspots, file structure,
and code survival curves.

Read CLAUDE.md for complete specs. Read BACKLOG.md for current status and remaining work.
The strategist should assess what's built vs what's missing and propose the next objective.
